  translation: "Tattoo artists deserve recognition and the chance to connect with the people who would be happiest wearing their work. Conventional business channels offer little protection against the fraudsters who copy and claim credit for artwork they lack the talent or ownership to deliver in ink. Peer-to-peer digital connectivity using the latest blockchain authentication technology gives artists total proof of creatorship while connecting them with potential clients worldwide in ways previously unimaginable."

Gogo Tattoo Project removes virtually all grounds for distrust between tattoo artist and the people who commission their work. Our blockchain-secured marketplace allows consumers to browse artists’ portfolios with absolute confidence that the work promised there can be delivered."

For artists, this means the chance to create, market, and licence your work in new ways. For consumers, it means the chance to seek out the right artist at any distance for tattoos connected to communities and stories or limited edition releases, to mention just a few possibilities..."
