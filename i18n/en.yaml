  translation: "Gogo Tattoo Project uses blockchain technology to offer tattoo artists an immutable lifetime record of their portfolios, proving creative ownership of their work for their own benefit and for the sake of the people who will wear it.

  translation: "Tattoo artists deserve recognition and the chance to connect with the people who would be happiest wearing their work. Conventional business channels offer little protection against the fraudsters who copy and claim credit for artwork they lack the talent or ownership to deliver in ink. Peer-to-peer digital connectivity using the latest blockchain authentication technology gives artists total proof of creatorship while connecting them with potential clients worldwide in ways previously unimaginable."

  translation: "Tattoo experiences are permanent, and no one wants a permanent regret. Gogo Tattoo Project removes virtually all grounds for distrust between tattoo artist and the people who commission their work. Our blockchain-secured marketplace allows consumers to browse artists’ portfolios with absolute confidence that the work promised there can be delivered."

  translation: "Unbreakable trust doesn’t just enhance traditional tattoo experiences. It enables tattoo experiences never before possible. For artists, this means the chance to create, market, and licence your work in new ways. For consumers, it means the chance to seek out the right artist at any distance for tattoos connected to communities and stories or limited edition releases, to mention just a few possibilities..."

    How we are tackling the road ahead...
- id: pr2.description
  translation: |
    There's been a lot of exciting news in the blockchain world these past few months,
    fascinating as well as frightening those of us who have been following.
    Interest in smart contacts is booming as this powerful new mechanism gains wider attention,
    while performance issues with consequences like <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereums-blockchain-accidentally-splits/" target="_blank">Ethereum's latest split</a> have many on edge
    and all of us watching closely.
    <br/><br/>
    In response to these developments gogo.tattoo is going ahead with development as
    planned while <a href="http://blog.akasha.world/2016/09/30/launch-imminent/" target="_blank">closely monitoring</a> the general environment in the peer to peer ecosystem. We feel it is important to take the long view of the road ahead, and not rush recklessly
    into new territory until more is understood about making ideas into realities with blockchain.
    <br/><br/>
    Projects we are excited to have in development include our <a href="/gogo">tattoo artist profile page</a>,
    where you will be able to showcase your work as part of a decentralized
    network of artists and tattoo enthusiasts around the world. We look forward to bringing you all this
    and more in the days to come, and as usual hope to hear from you about opportunities to collaborate.
    <br/><br/>
      Cheers,
      <br/><br/>
      The Gogo Tattoo Team
