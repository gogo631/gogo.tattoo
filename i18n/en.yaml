    How we are tackling the road ahead...
- id: pr2.description
  translation: |
    ---------------------
    There's been a lot of exciting news in the blockchain world these past few months,
    fascinating as well as frightening those of us who have been following.
    Interest in smart contacts is booming as this powerful new mechanism gains wider attention,
    while performance issues with consequences like <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereums-blockchain-accidentally-splits/" target="_blank">Ethereum's latest split</a> have many on edge
    and all of us watching closely.
    <br/><br/>
    In response to these developments gogo.tattoo is going ahead with development as
    planned while <a href="http://blog.akasha.world/2016/09/30/launch-imminent/" target="_blank">closely monitoring</a> the general environment in the peer to peer ecosystem. We feel it is important to take the long view of the road ahead, and not rush recklessly
    into new territory until more is understood about making ideas into realities with blockchain.
    <br/><br/>
    Projects we are excited to have in development include our <a href="/gogo">tattoo artist profile page</a>,
    where you will be able to showcase your work as part of a decentralized
    network of artists and tattoo enthusiasts around the world. We look forward to bringing you all this
    and more in the days to come, and as usual hope to hear from you about opportunities to collaborate.
    <br/><br/>
      Cheers,
      <br/><br/>

    Where the New Year finds us
- id: pr3.description
  translation: |
    ---------------------
    If you've been following gogo.tattoo since our launch this year you probably have some idea of how our
    mission is coming into focus. On the one hand the task before us is to develop the platform
    that will connect tattoo experiences with the incredible possibilities blockchain is enabling us to
     build for. On the other hand, we are working to grow our presence in the tattoo world organically,
      beginning from local connections with studios and artists who realize the potential of what we're
      working toward.

      The latest news is all exciting, whether you care most about tattoos or the tech that will change
      how they're made forever. We're working from an undisclosed location in an exciting city, where
      major players in the blockchain world are looking to invest their time, energy, and focus
      in projects that will take the revolution live. Coupled with promising attention in blockchain
      circles, the welcome we've earned with people who make their lives and livings in tattoo craft
      is driving our vision to reality in ways we never expected so soon. It was a major milestone to
      publish proof of work live from a tattoo session for the first time this month. Just as thrilling are the ways this experience continues
        to shed light on how gogo.tattoo can simultaneously benefit artists, their clients, and the studios where
        they meet. We've always known what we could do for people, but it means something more to
        hear it back.

      We're thrilled to be going into a new year with the enthusiasm of the people we're working for
      behind us. It's been a short, fast, wild ride through a horizon we are helping to push. What comes
      next is as sure to amaze as it is to surpise and enlighten us with what's to come. We look forward to a new year changing the world together from our unlikely
      corner of the creative world.


      Cheers,
      <br/><br/>

    Starting a busy year
- id: pr4.description
  translation: |
    ---------------------
    The new year finds us introducing a bunch of new features as we continue
    documenting our artists’ awesome new tattoos and researching our way forward.
    On the tech side, there are quite a few attractive new features on our site.
    First, we made our announcement posts separate pages with their own links:

      - [gogo.tattoo/post/2016-11-27-vision](http://gogo.tattoo/post/2016-11-27-vision)
      - [gogo.tattoo/post/2016-12-17-annual-summary](http://gogo.tattoo/post/2016-12-17-annual-summary)


    Meanwhile tattoo artists’ personal pages are looking better and better all
    the time. We think the Year of the Rooster is a great occasion to update
    our community on what’s been going on and where we are looking next by
    introducing some links to our latest features.

    <h3>Tags are up</h3>

    Tattoos are now tagged so visitors can find and follow artists based on
    their interests, making it easier for artists to reach the right
    audiences with their expertise and work history. Artists’ profile pages
    will show their tags right at the top of the page, and tattoo pages will
    show tags just below the image.

    Going forward visitors on gogo.tattoo will have an easy way of finding
    the artists who specialize in the kinds of designs they’re looking for,
    bringing us a huge step closer to realizing the transparent,
    human marketplace we envision gogo.tattoo becoming.

      - [//gogo/tattoo/anchored_infinity_moon](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/anchored_infinity_moon)

    <h3>New Design section: Link for ink</h3>

    Another way we’re helping connect great artists and the people who will enjoy
    their work is our new design section. It’s the place to showcase the work
    you’re looking to make next and get recognition for your creativity.

      - [gogo.tattoo/gogo/design](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/design)

    <h3>Github repository is alive</h3>

    For programmers and other collaborators looking to get involved at gogo.tattoo,
    [our github repo](http://github.com/gogotattoo) is filling up with ongoing updates
    on our progress and development. The demo/alpha version of the artists’ page is now open sourced.

    <h3>Gogo-upload</h3>

    [Gogo-upload](http://github.com/gogotattoo/gogo-upload) is an utility written in golang.
    It aims to add labeled watermarks, resize photos and upload
    the edited files to IPFS. It is half ready. We invite you to contibute.

    <h3>In other news… steemit noticed us</h3>

    We were the lucky number 8 at steemit in the daily curie best posts selection list.

      - [steemit.com/curation/@curie/the-daily-curie-22-23-jan-2017](https://steemit.com/curation/@curie/the-daily-curie-22-23-jan-2017)

      - [gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/pans_compass](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/pans_compass)

    Check out how our recent steemit promoted design found a happy owner.
    The process is documented in our demo/alpha website.

    <h3>...and we’d also like to mention the UN olive branch</h3>

    The other day a UN secretary-to-be collaborated with us for an olive branch tattoo design.
    Proud to be spreading the message of peace in these times!

      - [steemit.com/art/@gogo.tattoo/gogo-tattoo-fine-lines](https://steemit.com/art/@gogo.tattoo/gogo-tattoo-fine-lines)
      - [gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/olive_branch](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/olive_branch)

    Artist Valentin also updated the collection of work he’s documenting with us:

      - [gogo.tattoo/aid](http://gogo.tattoo/aid)

    Going forward we would like to begin connecting with people interested
    in helping us document work at greater distances worldwide,
    and hope to speak more with photographers and tattoo people interested
    in getting great work recognized at its most beautiful.

    We continue to follow the progress at projects like [colony.io](https://blog.colony.io/colony-q1-update-b386425e0a00#.ns7jb5ggu),
    [akasha](http://blog.akasha.world/2017/01/16/into-the-ether/),
    [ark.io](https://blog.ark.io/the-ark-tec-is-over-prepare-to-board-the-ark-e40d7f90ace9#.6647a91y4),
    waves, lisk, and never miss a chance to [check up](https://blog.ethereum.org)
    on developments at Ethereum, among others.

    Our community is growing fast and worldwide.

    Keep checking back for news!

    Happy New Year,

    Spring 2017 Update
- id: pr5.description
  translation: |
    ---------------------
    A lot's been happening at [gogo.tattoo](/) these past few months, giving us plenty of updates to report as we ease into Labor Day weekend.
    Open sourced backend/frontend development continues to drive our evolution as a platform in exciting directions, while our core group of artists working at the studio level has grown with the recent addition of tattoo master Xizi.

    - [github.com/gogotattoo](https://github.com/gogotattoo)
    - [gogo.tattoo/xizi](http://gogo.tattoo/xizi)

    One development after another, our vision of a seamless interface between artists, clients, studios, and the individual tattoo sessions we're working to document is taking form at gogo.tattoo.

    On the mobile side, we're hard at work on the alpha version of our open-sourced Android app.

    - [app.gogo.tattoo](http://app.gogo.tattoo)
    - [github.com/gogotattoo/gogo-android](https://github.com/gogotattoo/gogo-android)

    It's now approved on GooglePlay, so please get in contact if you're interested in being an alpha tester!
    Adding to the excitement, the gogo.tattoo iOS app is also now in active development.

    - [github.com/gogotattoo/gogo-ios](https://github.com/gogotattoo/gogo-ios)

    New features include automatic watermarking for posted images and artist page localization, supporting our goal of offering talented artists visibility to international audiences beyond the regions where they are based.
    You can now view our artists' pages in [Russian](http://gogo.tattoo/xizi/ru) and [Chinese](http://gogo.tattoo/xizi/zh-hant), as well as [English](http://gogo.tattoo/xizi).
    Meanwhile we've launched a page dedicated to the incredible studio that's been at the heart of the action so far, downtown Shanghai's Chu Shang Feng.
    To see where we've been documenting so much of the work on our site you can now visit this link:

    - [gogo.tattoo/@chushangfeng](http://gogo.tattoo/@chushangfeng)

    On the horizon, we are getting ready to launch tattube, a decentralized youtube for tattoos hosted on the InterPlanetary File System.

    - [github.com/gogotattoo/ipfstube](https://github.com/gogotattoo/ipfstube)

    It's all happening fast now and we're anticipating big news in the months ahead.
    Along with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogo_tattoo) you can now follow us on [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@gogo.tattoo), where you can hear more about our [talented artists](https://steemit.com/@gogotattoo) and [the works](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo) they've been doing with us.

    Part of our team, including [Yana](http://gogo.tattoo/yana) Gogo herself, are heading to Russia, where she and [Valentin](http://gogo.tattoo/aid) are goint to participate in the Saint-Petersburg Tattoo Weekend, taking place from May 12 to 14.

    ---------------------
    It’s only been a month since our last update, but there’s a lot to report already.
    Two of our artists recently attended the [Saint Petersburg Tattoo Weekend](http://tattoo-weekend.ru) in Russia,
    connecting with clients for three awesome new works that you can view in their profiles:

    - [gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/three_charm](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/three_charm)
    - [gogo.tattoo/aid/tattoo/zombie_butterfly](http://gogo.tattoo/aid/tattoo/zombie_butterfly)
    - [gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/taurus_roses](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/taurus_roses)

    Valentin and Yana had a double booth at the center of the festivities,
    right next to Tianjin-based artist [Shijian](https://vk.com/sjworkshop)’s spot.
    We were quite fascinated by this artist’s story and are looking to invite him to join our team.
    Opposite our booth was Ukrainian master [Valera Ronenko](http://tattooweek.ru/artist/valera_ronenko?lang=en).

    </center>

    Another outcome of the trip: we are happy to be joined by yet another talented artist this month.
    Welcome Vitaly Klimin! Check out his page, where we look forward to posting much work to come:

    - [gogo.tattoo/klimin](http://gogo.tattoo/klimin)

    On the development side our iOS app is looking better and better.
    Contact [our developers](https://github.com/orgs/gogotattoo/people/HongliYu) for a closer look or about getting involved!

    Along with our home [Chushangfeng](http://gogo.tattoo/@chushangfeng) in Shanghai,
    we now have a page for the [Aid Tattoo studio](http://gogo.tattoo/@aid_tattoo) in Gatchina, Russia, where Valentin and Vitaly will continue to base their work.
    The shop pages are still in active development, but deployed and ready to be seen:

    - [gogo.tattoo/@chushangfeng](http://gogo.tattoo/@chushangfeng)
    - [gogo.tattoo/@aid_tattoo](http://gogo.tattoo/@aid_tattoo)

    Many thanks to Chris 朱明阳 (suyihan1994 [at] foxmail.com) for drawing the design for our latest logo:

    <center>  ![gogopher-app-logo](/img/post/2017-4.png) </center>

    Along with all the developments in house, we are broadening our work with other projects in the blockchain community.
    We’re closely following developments at Decent, Steem, Skycoin, Golos, and others, expanding our collaboration with projects redefining the possibilities of networks.
    Blockchain is exciting and we are excited to be helping move it forward.

    Upcoming we have a partnership with [gre3n] (http://gogre3n.com) to look forward to,
    who are as enthusiastic about tattoos as we are about coconut oil.
    Unlike vaseline, coconut oil is a natural antibacterial and antifungal,
    making it great for the skin after a tattoo session. Look forward to seeing more on that soon.

    We are now recording artists' new works to two different blockchains, and looking to add more.
    It’s our way of making sure that our record is universal, with links to each of the chains where our artist portfolios are permanently coded that you can now find beside each of their works.

    Things are happening faster and faster each time we check in.
    We're looking forward for the long hot summer of 2017 and seeing where it takes us.

    Check back for more soon!

    It’s been a great summer at Gogo Tattoo with lots going on and even more coming up.

    The biggest news right now is our Russia based artist Valentin will be coming to Shanghai next month and is looking to book sessions with people interested in his work starting mid-September. Valentin is in town for the Shanghai International T-A-F tattoo festival, happening September 22 - 24. He’ll be doing work live on site if you’d like to come by.

    ![Valentin Aidov @ Shanghai Tattoo Autumn Festival](http://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXbWGhZaEHhXtUKsNLhsqaLq4WSGxjgPnj8eS5sEiuKmy)

    If you want to reach Valentin or would like to have a tattoo made at T-A-F please contact us so we can get you in touch. You can see Valentin’s portfolio here:

    We’ve recently added support for session videos to artist pages.
    Artists now can upload their works to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) with watermarking using [gogo.tattoo app](http://app.gogo.tattoo)!
    This feature is still only available on our Android app, but we’ll have the same feature up on the iOS gogo.tattoo app soon.

    In other news, we made a new friend in nearby Shaxi last weekend who will be joining us as soon as we finish building his artist page.
    Welcome Aidehua! We enjoyed visiting your studio and your tour through the area.
    Highly recommend a trip through this waterside town just outside downtown Shanghai.

    Our app is now easier to navigate thanks to Prev and Next tabs on tattoo images.
    We’ve also made it easier to select and preview photos before sharing.
    Video watermarking/uploading is supported by the API and already applied in the Android gogo.tattoo app.
    Watermarking is getting better and better (generation-v4 already) and there’s lots more in the works, so check back often to see how we’re developing!

    On the social side, we now have over 200 followers on Steemit (in case you’re wondering why we like it so much we’d make those designs). Also, take a look at this…

    Making six tattoos at two awesome events isn’t bad for a first [trip to Shanghai](https://steemit.com/tattoo/@gogotattoo/gogo-the-shanghai-tattoo-journey-with-aid). Last month Russian tattoo master [Valentin](http://gogo.tattoo/aid) traveled here to meet clients in China and visit us at [Chushangfeng](http://gogo.tattoo/@chushangfeng), and along with everything else going on it's been nonstop in and out of the studio. Valentin’s been working with [gogo.tattoo](http://gogo.tattoo) for almost a year now, reminding us that our one-year anniversary is coming up fast.

    Valentin’s new works from Shanghai are now up on his artist page. We recommend checking out shots from his session at [Shanghai International Tattoo Festival](https://steemit.com/tattoo/@gogotattoo/gogo-tattoo-t-a-f-shanghai) -- especially [Samurai Skull](http://gogo.tattoo/aid/tattoo/samurai_skull), designed by [Dmitriy Kazimirov](https://vk.com/airbrushspb). He also joined us for the trip to [Shalanaya](https://www.facebook.com/shalanaya.festival/) for three days during the October holiday, where he and Gogo performed about 50 henna designs for people visiting the festival. It’s been fun and busy showing him Shanghai, and good to see artists and clients without borders making use of our platform.

    Before heading back to Russia Valentin joined us in the studio one last time to make [Beauty Mind](http://gogo.tattoo/aid/tattoo/beauty_mind) for Gogo, completing her sleeve (for the time being). [Gogo](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo) is extremely happy with it, and we hope you’ll take a second to see the story it tells. (Inside the matryoshka doll he designed the cyrillic “Ум”, meaning "mind", as well as whatever else you find in this poetic image.) Gogo’s mind is going to be running pretty wild with coding at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/shanghai) in the next three months. So you may experience a slight interruption in the flow of awesome works of her’s we’ve been posting recently. Looking forward to having another full-stack developer onboard who also doubles in our core tattoo talent here.

    On the blockchain side, we met some of the people working at [Smart Valor](https://smartvalor.com/) at [Slush Shanghai](http://shanghai.slush.org/), finding common ground in enthusiasm for smart contracts and free banking. The blockchain community is growing and we’re looking forward to the future ecosystem that will let us do more of the things we do with the freedom of smart networks. More and more people seem to be thinking the same way lately, including some we met who are working with startups at Google. They seemed pretty interested in tattoos hitting the blockchain, too. We’re looking forward to more updates on the tech side, so check back for news soon!

    By the way, find us for details if you’d like to join the celebration when we turn one next month. We’re going to party our faces off, so join if you’re in Shanghai!
