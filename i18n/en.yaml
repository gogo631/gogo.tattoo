    How we are tackling the road ahead...
- id: pr2.description
  translation: |
    There's been a lot of exciting news in the blockchain world these past few months,
    fascinating as well as frightening those of us who have been following.
    Interest in smart contacts is booming as this powerful new mechanism gains wider attention,
    while performance issues with consequences like <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereums-blockchain-accidentally-splits/" target="_blank">Ethereum's latest split</a> have many on edge
    and all of us watching closely.
    <br/><br/>
    In response to these developments gogo.tattoo is going ahead with development as
    planned while <a href="http://blog.akasha.world/2016/09/30/launch-imminent/" target="_blank">closely monitoring</a> the general environment in the peer to peer ecosystem. We feel it is important to take the long view of the road ahead, and not rush recklessly
    into new territory until more is understood about making ideas into realities with blockchain.
    <br/><br/>
    Projects we are excited to have in development include our <a href="/gogo">tattoo artist profile page</a>,
    where you will be able to showcase your work as part of a decentralized
    network of artists and tattoo enthusiasts around the world. We look forward to bringing you all this
    and more in the days to come, and as usual hope to hear from you about opportunities to collaborate.
    <br/><br/>
      Cheers,
      <br/><br/>

    Where the New Year finds us
- id: pr3.description
  translation: |
    If you've been following gogo.tattoo since our launch this year you probably have some idea of how our
    mission is coming into focus. On the one hand the task before us is to develop the platform
    that will connect tattoo experiences with the incredible possibilities blockchain is enabling us to
     build for. On the other hand, we are working to grow our presence in the tattoo world organically,
      beginning from local connections with studios and artists who realize the potential of what we're
      working toward.

      The latest news is all exciting, whether you care most about tattoos or the tech that will change
      how they're made forever. We're working from an undisclosed location in an exciting city, where
      major players in the blockchain world are looking to invest their time, energy, and focus
      in projects that will take the revolution live. Coupled with promising attention in blockchain
      circles, the welcome we've earned with people who make their lives and livings in tattoo craft
      is driving our vision to reality in ways we never expected so soon. It was a major milestone to
      publish proof of work live from a tattoo session for the first time this month. Just as thrilling are the ways this experience continues
        to shed light on how gogo.tattoo can simultaneously benefit artists, their clients, and the studios where
        they meet. We've always known what we could do for people, but it means something more to
        hear it back.

      We're thrilled to be going into a new year with the enthusiasm of the people we're working for
      behind us. It's been a short, fast, wild ride through a horizon we are helping to push. What comes
      next is as sure to amaze as it is to surpise and enlighten us with what's to come. We look forward to a new year changing the world together from our unlikely
      corner of the creative world.


      Cheers,
      <br/><br/>
      The Gogo Tattoo Team
