    How we are tackling the road ahead...
- id: pr2.description
  translation: |
    ---------------------
    There's been a lot of exciting news in the blockchain world these past few months,
    fascinating as well as frightening those of us who have been following.
    Interest in smart contacts is booming as this powerful new mechanism gains wider attention,
    while performance issues with consequences like <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereums-blockchain-accidentally-splits/" target="_blank">Ethereum's latest split</a> have many on edge
    and all of us watching closely.
    <br/><br/>
    In response to these developments gogo.tattoo is going ahead with development as
    planned while <a href="http://blog.akasha.world/2016/09/30/launch-imminent/" target="_blank">closely monitoring</a> the general environment in the peer to peer ecosystem. We feel it is important to take the long view of the road ahead, and not rush recklessly
    into new territory until more is understood about making ideas into realities with blockchain.
    <br/><br/>
    Projects we are excited to have in development include our <a href="/gogo">tattoo artist profile page</a>,
    where you will be able to showcase your work as part of a decentralized
    network of artists and tattoo enthusiasts around the world. We look forward to bringing you all this
    and more in the days to come, and as usual hope to hear from you about opportunities to collaborate.
    <br/><br/>
      Cheers,
      <br/><br/>

    Where the New Year finds us
- id: pr3.description
  translation: |
    ---------------------
    If you've been following gogo.tattoo since our launch this year you probably have some idea of how our
    mission is coming into focus. On the one hand the task before us is to develop the platform
    that will connect tattoo experiences with the incredible possibilities blockchain is enabling us to
     build for. On the other hand, we are working to grow our presence in the tattoo world organically,
      beginning from local connections with studios and artists who realize the potential of what we're
      working toward.

      The latest news is all exciting, whether you care most about tattoos or the tech that will change
      how they're made forever. We're working from an undisclosed location in an exciting city, where
      major players in the blockchain world are looking to invest their time, energy, and focus
      in projects that will take the revolution live. Coupled with promising attention in blockchain
      circles, the welcome we've earned with people who make their lives and livings in tattoo craft
      is driving our vision to reality in ways we never expected so soon. It was a major milestone to
      publish proof of work live from a tattoo session for the first time this month. Just as thrilling are the ways this experience continues
        to shed light on how gogo.tattoo can simultaneously benefit artists, their clients, and the studios where
        they meet. We've always known what we could do for people, but it means something more to
        hear it back.

      We're thrilled to be going into a new year with the enthusiasm of the people we're working for
      behind us. It's been a short, fast, wild ride through a horizon we are helping to push. What comes
      next is as sure to amaze as it is to surpise and enlighten us with what's to come. We look forward to a new year changing the world together from our unlikely
      corner of the creative world.


      Cheers,
      <br/><br/>

    Starting a busy year
- id: pr4.description
  translation: |
    ---------------------
    The new year finds us introducing a bunch of new features as we continue
    documenting our artists’ awesome new tattoos and researching our way forward.
    On the tech side, there are quite a few attractive new features on our site.
    First, we made our announcement posts separate pages with their own links:

      - [gogo.tattoo/post/2016-11-27-vision](http://gogo.tattoo/post/2016-11-27-vision)
      - [gogo.tattoo/post/2016-12-17-annual-summary](http://gogo.tattoo/post/2016-12-17-annual-summary)


    Meanwhile tattoo artists’ personal pages are looking better and better all
    the time. We think the Year of the Rooster is a great occasion to update
    our community on what’s been going on and where we are looking next by
    introducing some links to our latest features.

    <h3>Tags are up</h3>

    Tattoos are now tagged so visitors can find and follow artists based on
    their interests, making it easier for artists to reach the right
    audiences with their expertise and work history. Artists’ profile pages
    will show their tags right at the top of the page, and tattoo pages will
    show tags just below the image.

    Going forward visitors on gogo.tattoo will have an easy way of finding
    the artists who specialize in the kinds of designs they’re looking for,
    bringing us a huge step closer to realizing the transparent,
    human marketplace we envision gogo.tattoo becoming.

      - [//gogo/tattoo/anchored_infinity_moon](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/tattoo/anchored_infinity_moon)

    <h3>New Design section: Link for ink</h3>

    Another way we’re helping connect great artists and the people who will enjoy
    their work is our new design section. It’s the place to showcase the work
    you’re looking to make next and get recognition for your creativity.

      - [gogo.tattoo/gogo/design](http://gogo.tattoo/gogo/design)

    <h3>Github repository is alive</h3>

    For programmers and other collaborators looking to get involved at gogo.tattoo,
    [our github repo](http://github.com/gogotattoo) is filling up with ongoing updates
    on our progress and development. The demo/alpha version of the artists’ page is now open sourced.

    <h3>Gogo-upload</h3>

    [Gogo-upload](http://github.com/gogotattoo/gogo-upload) is an utility written in golang.
    It aims to add labeled watermarks, resize photos and upload
    the edited files to IPFS. It is half ready. We invite you to contibute.

    <h3>In other news… steemit noticed us</h3>

    We were the lucky number 8 at steemit in the daily curie best posts selection list.

      - [steemit.com/curation/@curie/the-daily-curie-22-23-jan-2017](https://steemit.com/curation/@curie/the-daily-curie-22-23-jan-2017)

    Check out how our recent steemit promoted design found a happy owner.
    The process is documented in our demo/alpha website.

    <h3>...and we’d also like to mention the UN olive branch</h3>

    The other day a UN secretary-to-be collaborated with us for an olive branch tattoo design.
    Proud to be spreading the message of peace in these times!

    Artist Valentin also updated the collection of work he’s documenting with us:

      - [gogo.tattoo/aid](http://gogo.tattoo/aid)

    Going forward we would like to begin connecting with people interested
    in helping us document work at greater distances worldwide,
    and hope to speak more with photographers and tattoo people interested
    in getting great work recognized at its most beautiful.

    We continue to follow the progress at projects like [colony.io](https://blog.colony.io/colony-q1-update-b386425e0a00#.ns7jb5ggu),
    [akasha](http://blog.akasha.world/2017/01/16/into-the-ether/),

    waves, lisk, and never miss a chance to [check up](https://blog.ethereum.org)
    on developments at Ethereum, among others.

    Our community is growing fast and worldwide.

    Keep checking back for news!

    Happy New Year,

    [The Gogo Tattoo Team](/)
